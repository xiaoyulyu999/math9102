"""MATH9102 Fundamentals of Data Analysis - course support package.

A thin layer over the standard scientific Python stack. Notebooks perform their
analysis with scipy, statsmodels and pingouin directly, so students learn the
standard tools; this package supplies only what would otherwise be copied from
week to week: dataset loaders, descriptive and diagnostic panels, effect sizes,
the one post-hoc test the standard stack lacks, a shared figure style, and
generated result narratives.

Typical use at the top of a notebook::

    import math9102 as m9
    m9.use_house_style()
    survey = m9.load_survey()

Design rules, recorded in docs/DECISIONS.md:

1. No statistic is ever typed into prose - `report.*` generates it from the data
   and a live result object.
2. Datasets are loaded by name, never by path.
3. Helpers stay thin enough to read; nothing here hides a decision a student
   should be making.
